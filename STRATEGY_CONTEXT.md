# Betterish: Go-To-Market & Business Context

## 1. SWOT Analysis (Preliminary)

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Unique, relatable "voice" <br> - AI integration (Gemini) is genuinely useful for breaking down tasks <br> - Niche focus (Dads 0-8yr) | - New entrant in crowded "ToDo" market <br> - Reliance on API costs (AI tokens) <br> - "Tired" users might churn if onboarding isn't instant |

| Opportunities | Threats |
| :--- | :--- |
| - "Dad Tech" is an underserved market <br> - Virality through humor (sharing funny AI responses) <br> - Partnerships with dad influencers/podcasts | - Generic AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini app) improving at specific advice <br> - "Sherlocking" by Apple Reminders/Todoist |

## 2. Pricing Strategy Ideas
*   **Model A: Freemium (Recommended)**
    *   **Free:** Basic tasks, "Survival" mode, Pre-set libraries.
    *   **Pro ($4.99/mo or $45/yr):** Unlimited AI Chat ("Dad Friend"), Custom Projects, Advanced Stats/History.
*   **Model B: One-Time "Coffee" Purchase**
    *   $9.99 lifetime unlock. Simpler, but harder to cover recurring AI API costs.

## 3. Marketing Channels (The "Scrappy" Plan)
1.  **Reddit (r/daddit, r/parenting):**
    *   *Strategy:* "Build in Public." Share the story of building this *because* you were tired. Ask for feedback. Don't "market," just share.
2.  **Twitter/X:**
    *   *Content:* Share funny "Dad vs. AI" interactions from the app.
    *   *Tag:* #buildinpublic, #dadlife.
3.  **Product Hunt:**
    *   Launch as "The To-Do list for dads who are barely hanging on."

## 4. Next Steps for Research
Use these prompts with Gemini Deep Think:
1.  *"Analyze the reviews of 'Todoist' and 'Any.do' looking for keywords related to 'parenting', 'overwhelm', or 'complex'. Identify gaps Betterish can fill."*
2.  *"Generate 10 viral content ideas for TikTok/Reels that demonstrate the 'Dad AI' humor features of Betterish."*
3.  *"Create a user persona for 'Mark', a 34-year-old new dad working in tech. What are his specific daily friction points?"*
