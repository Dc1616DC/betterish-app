# Betterish: Brand Identity Guide

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone
Our voice is the differentiator. If the app sounds like a corporation or a "guru," we fail.

*   **Persona:** A dad friend texting you at 11 PM.
*   **Key Traits:**
    *   **Honest:** We admit parenting is hard. We don't sugarcoat.
    *   **Funny:** We use humor to cope. Dad jokes are legal tender here.
    *   **Empathetic:** We never shame. We always validate.
    *   **Concise:** Tired dads don't read paragraphs. They read bullet points.

**Do vs. Don't:**
*   **Do:** "Keep everyone alive today."
*   **Don't:** "Maximize your daily parenting potential."
*   **Do:** "You missed a task. Who cares? Try again tomorrow."
*   **Don't:** "Your streak is at risk! Complete a task now to maintain momentum."

## 2. Visual Identity (Dark Mode First)
Designed for low-light environments (nursery, late-night scrolling).

### Color Palette
*   **Dad Background:** `#1a1b1e` (Deep, restful charcoal. Not harsh black.)
*   **Dad Card:** `#25262b` (Slightly lighter for hierarchy.)
*   **Dad Primary (Action):** `#f97316` (Warm Orange. Energetic but friendly.)
*   **Dad Accent (Wins):** `#eab308` (Golden Yellow. For streaks and trophies.)
*   **Dad Muted:** `#94a3b8` (Slate Blue/Grey. For low-priority info.)

### Typography
*   Clean, sans-serif. Large touch targets.
*   High readability.

## 3. UI/UX Principles
*   **The "Thumb Zone":** Key actions must be reachable with one hand (while holding a baby).
*   **Low Friction:** Adding a task should take < 3 seconds.
*   **Forgiving:** Undo buttons everywhere. Easy to reschedule.
